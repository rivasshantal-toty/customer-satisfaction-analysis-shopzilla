# Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) Analysis – Shopzilla

## Project Overview
This project analyses customer satisfaction trends for a simulated e-commerce platform (Shopzilla) to identify the key drivers of declining CSAT scores and provide data-driven recommendations to improve customer experience.

## Business Problem
Customer satisfaction scores were declining due to increasing customer complaints. The objective was to identify:
- The most common complaint categories
- The impact of agent response times on CSAT
- Opportunities to improve customer support and logistics processes

## Tools Used
- SQL (BigQuery)
- Tableau
- Excel

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle (simulated customer support data)
- Size: 85,000+ rows, 20 columns
- Data includes CSAT scores, complaint categories, response times, and customer feedback

## Key Analysis Steps
- Cleaned and transformed data (handled missing values, corrected timestamps)
- Analysed complaint frequency and CSAT distribution using SQL
- Evaluated the relationship between response time and CSAT
- Built Tableau dashboards to visualise trends and insights

## Key Findings
- Over 80% of complaints were related to returns and order issues
- Faster response times were associated with higher CSAT scores
- A large proportion of complaints lacked detailed customer feedback

## Recommendations
- Improve quality control and logistics processes
- Reduce response times through automation and better workflows
- Encourage detailed customer feedback through improved collection methods

## Deliverables
- Full technical analysis report (PDF)
- Executive-style presentation summarising insights and recommendations
- Tableau dashboard (screenshots included in presentation)
